# C++ Discrete Wavelet Transform Using Lifting Method

This library implements lifting scheme based on Sweldens/Daubechies paper. I. Daubechies, W. Sweldens, Factoring wavelets
transforms into lifting steps, J. Fourier Anal. Appl. 4 (3) (1998) 247-269. It is highly recommended that you download a
copy of the paper from either the website of the Journal or from http://cm.bell-labs.com/who/wim/papers/factor/index.html 
(See Figure 7 and 8 for implementation details)
